Caps is an application for calculation of torisferic caps, I mean, concave bottoms consisting of a spherical cap, a part-ring binding and a surrounding cylindrical, having these three components common tangents at the junction points.
In particular funds estimated Kloepper, which is a fund torisférico where relations between the spokes and the outer diameter, the following conditions, R / De = 1.0 and r / De = 0.1, and funds Korboggen, which is a fund torisférico for which R / De = 0.8 and r / De = 0.154.

This application allows to calculate all parameters of the fund as well as the maximum pressure that supports them.

Caps is based on the UNE EN 13445-3:2002, "Pressure vessels not subject to the action of the flame. Part 3: Design"
